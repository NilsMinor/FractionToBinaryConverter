# FractionToBinaryConverter
Tiny qt tool to compute a fraction part of a number to its represented value which could be written into a register, for a micro controller for example

I used it to compute the fraction par of a number to the binary value to write it to a regsiter of the MAX78630 controller. The format of the 24 Bit register was |2^-1|2^-2|2^-3 ....|2^-23|2^-24|. I solved the problem/recalculation by writing this tiny tool in Qt :)
